## Tecnhologies
This game has been made with html, css and javascript. In the css it has included media queries to make it responsive both in mobile and in tablet. Also webkit-keyframes have been used to add animations to the cards when they are displayed and when they are paired.  In javascript, predefined functions such as setInterval() and clearInterval() have been used to monitor the game time and reset it when the player plays again.
Also libraries such as the Sweet Alert plugin have been used to congratulate the player or tell him that he has lost. And the shuffle() function found in the link  http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976 has also been used.
